Problem 1 Activation Keys
You are about to make some good money, but first, you need to think of a way to verify who paid for your product and who didn't. You have decided to let people use the software for a free trial period and then require an activation key to continue using the product. Before you can cash out, the last step is to design a program that creates unique activation keys for each user. So, waste no more time and start typing!
The first line of the input will be your raw activation key. It will consist of letters and numbers only. 
After that, until the "Generate" command is given, you will be receiving strings with instructions for different operations that need to be performed upon the raw activation key.
There are several types of instructions, split by ">>>":
•	"Contains>>>{substring}":
o	If the raw activation key contains the given substring, prints: "{raw activation key} contains {substring}".
o	Otherwise, prints: "Substring not found!"
•	"Flip>>>Upper/Lower>>>{startIndex}>>>{endIndex}":
o	Changes the substring between the given indices (the end index is exclusive) to upper or lower case and then prints the activation key.
o	All given indexes will be valid.
•	"Slice>>>{startIndex}>>>{endIndex}":
o	Deletes the characters between the start and end indices (the end index is exclusive) and prints the activation key.
o	Both indices will be valid.
Input
•	The first line of the input will be a string consisting of letters and numbers only. 
•	After the first line, until the "Generate" command is given, you will be receiving strings.
Output
•	After the "Generate" command is received, print:
o	"Your activation key is: {activation key}"

Problem 2 - Emoji Detector
Your task is to write a program that extracts emojis from a text and find the threshold based on the input.
You have to get your cool threshold. It is obtained by multiplying all the digits found in the input.  The cool threshold could be a huge number, so be mindful.
An emoji is valid when:
•	It is surrounded by 2 characters, either "::" or "**"
•	It is at least 3 characters long (without the surrounding symbols)
•	It starts with a capital letter
•	Continues with lowercase letters only
Examples of valid emojis: ::Joy::, **Banana**, ::Wink::
Examples of invalid emojis: ::Joy**, ::fox:es:, **Monk3ys**, :Snak::Es::
You need to count all valid emojis in the text and calculate their coolness. The coolness of the emoji is determined by summing all the ASCII values of all letters in the emoji. 
Examples: ::Joy:: - 306, **Banana** - 577, ::Wink:: - 409
You need to print the result of the cool threshold and, after that take all emojis out of the text, count them and print only the cool ones on the console.
Input
•	On the single input, you will receive a piece of string. 
Output
•	On the first line of the output, print the obtained Cool threshold in the format:
"Cool threshold: {coolThresholdSum}"
•	On the following line, print the count of all emojis found in the text in the format:
"{countOfAllEmojis} emojis found in the text. The cool ones are:
{cool emoji 1}
{cool emoji 2}
…
{cool emoji N}"
Constraints
There will always be at least one digit in the text!

Problem 3 - Bonus Scoring System.
Create a program that calculates bonus points for each student enrolled in a course. On the first line, you are going to receive the number of students. On the second line, you will receive the total number of lectures in the course. The course has an additional bonus, which you will receive on the third line. On the following lines, you will be receiving the count of attendances for each student.
The bonus is calculated with the following formula:
{total bonus} = {student attendances} / {course lectures} * (5 + {additional bonus})
Find the student with the maximum bonus and print them, along with his attendance, in the following format:
"Max Bonus: {max bonus points}."
"The student has attended {student attendances} lectures."
Round the bonus points at the end to the nearest larger number.
Input / Constraints
•	On the first line, you are going to receive the number of the students – an integer in the range [0…50].
•	On the second line, you will receive the number of the lectures – an integer number in the range [0...50].
•	On the third line, you will receive the additional bonus – an integer number in the range [0….100].
•	On the following lines, you will be receiving the attendance of each student.
•	There will never be students with equal bonuses.
Output
•	Print the maximum bonus points and the attendance of the given student, rounded to the nearest larger number, scored by a student in this course in the format described above.

Problem 4 - Password Reset
Yet again, you have forgotten your password. Naturally, it's not the first time this has happened. Actually, you got so tired of it that you decided to help yourself with an intelligent solution.
Write a password reset program that performs a series of commands upon a predefined string. First, you will receive a string, and afterward, until the command "Done" is given, you will be receiving strings with commands split by a single space. The commands will be the following:
•	"TakeOdd"
o	 Takes only the characters at odd indices and concatenates them to obtain the new raw password and then prints it.
•	"Cut {index} {length}"
o	Gets the substring with the given length starting from the given index from the password and removes its first occurrence, then prints the password on the console.
o	The given index and the length will always be valid.
•	"Substitute {substring} {substitute}"
o	If the raw password contains the given substring, replace all of its occurrences with the substitute text given and print the result.
o	If it doesn't, prints "Nothing to replace!".
Input
•	You will be receiving strings until the "Done" command is given.
Output
•	After the "Done" command is received, print:
o	"Your password is: {password}"
Constraints
•	The indexes from the "Cut {index} {length}" command will always be valid.

Problem 5 - Secret Chat
You have plenty of free time, so you decide to write a program that conceals and reveals your received messages. Go ahead and type it in!
On the first line of the input, you will receive the concealed message. After that, until the "Reveal" command is given, you will receive strings with instructions for different operations that need to be performed upon the concealed message to interpret it and reveal its actual content. There are several types of instructions, split by ":|:"
•	"InsertSpace:|:{index}":
o	Inserts a single space at the given index. The given index will always be valid.
•	"Reverse:|:{substring}":
o	If the message contains the given substring, cut it out, reverse it and add it at the end of the message. 
o	If not, print "error".
o	This operation should replace only the first occurrence of the given substring if there are two or more occurrences.
•	"ChangeAll:|:{substring}:|:{replacement}":
o	Changes all occurrences of the given substring with the replacement text.
Input / Constraints
•	On the first line, you will receive a string with a message.
•	On the following lines, you will be receiving commands, split by ":|:".
Output
•	After each set of instructions, print the resulting string. 
•	After the "Reveal" command is received, print this message:
"You have a new text message: {message}"

Problem 6 - Mirror words
The SoftUni Spelling Bee competition is here. But it`s not like any other Spelling Bee competition out there. It`s different and a lot more fun! You, of course, are a participant, and you are eager to show the competition that you are the best, so go ahead, learn the rules and win!
On the first line of the input, you will be given a text string. To win the competition, you have to find all hidden word pairs, read them, and mark the ones that are mirror images of each other.
First of all, you have to extract the hidden word pairs. Hidden word pairs are:
•	Surrounded by "@" or "#" (only one of the two) in the following pattern #wordOne##wordTwo# or @wordOne@@wordTwo@
•	At least 3 characters long each (without the surrounding symbols).
•	Made up of letters only.
If the second word, spelled backward, is the same as the first word and vice versa (casing matters!), they are a match, and you have to store them somewhere. Examples of mirror words: 
#Part##traP# @leveL@@Level@ #sAw##wAs#
•	If you don`t find any valid pairs, print: "No word pairs found!"
•	If you find valid pairs print their count: "{valid pairs count} word pairs found!"
•	If there are no mirror words, print: "No mirror words!"
•	If there are mirror words print:
"The mirror words are:
{wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}, {wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}, … {wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}"
Input / Constraints
•	You will recive a string.
Output
•	Print the proper output messages in the proper cases as described in the problem description.
•	If there are pairs of mirror words, print them in the end, each pair separated by ", ".
•	Each pair of mirror word must be printed with " <=> " between the words.

"{car} driven for {distance} kilometers. {fuel} liters of fuel consumed."
o	You like driving new cars only, so if a car's mileage reaches 100 000 km, remove it from the collection(s) and print: "Time to sell the {car}!"
•	"Refuel : {car} : {fuel}":
o	Refill the tank of your car. 
o	Each tank can hold a maximum of 75 liters of fuel, so if the given amount of fuel is more than you can fit in the tank, take only what is required to fill it up.
